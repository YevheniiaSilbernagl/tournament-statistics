        <p>The Community Championship is a sixteen person invite-only tournament that takes place over two days: <strong>
            March 23 and 24, 2019</strong>
            . The winner will receive an invitation to the <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/eternal-world-championship-2019/" target="_blank">
                Eternal World Championship 2019</a>
            , where they will be representing the entire community tournament playerbase.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">How do I qualify?</h2>
        <p>You qualify for the Community Championship by doing what you’re hopefully already doing – playing in the Eternal Tournament Series! Players who do well in the ETS are awarded <a href="@routes.Application.seriesPoints()">
            Series Points</a>
            as a numerical indication of their success. We will be tracking all Series Points awarded between now and the Community Championship under a separate “season,” the Community Championship Series Point Leaderboard. Everyone starts at zero – it’s how you do between now and the Championship that matters. After the 2019 Season One Invitational on March 9th and 10th, 2019, <strong>
                the top sixteen (16) players on the Community Championship Series Point Leaderboard will be invited to participate in the event.</strong>
            Ties will be broken by Eternal matches, as usual.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><strong>There are no direct invites to the 2019 Community Championship.</strong></p>
        <h3><em>
            Series Points earned from the 2018 ETS World Championships DO NOT count towards the Community Championship Series Point Leaderboard.</em></h3>
